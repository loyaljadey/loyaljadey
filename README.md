I am second year undergraduate at UC Berkeley majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Aerospace Engineering and a minor in EECS. 
Outside of academics, I am a part of CalSol, the Berkeley solar vehicle team and Underwater Robotics at Berkeley, a robotics team at Berkeley competing in RoboSub. 
In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering, fabricating cool parts with my Creality Ender 3, or playing ultimate frisbee, badminton, or biking. 
Currently working on integrating a VESC with a motor to make my bike electric. 
Please contact me with any questions about my projects or any research/internship opportunities. 

Here you will find a collection of my past computer science projects ranging from HTML websites to Android applications developed with Android Studio and Java Data Structures Projects.
