I am second year undergraduate at UC Berkeley majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Aerospace Engineering and a minor in EECS. 
Outside of academics, I am the structural lead of CalSol, the UC Berkeley Solar Vehicle Team, a member of Underwater Robotics at Berkeley (a robotics team at Berkeley competing in RoboSub), and a member of the Bike Builders of Berkeley Club. 

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering, fabricating cool parts with my PrintrBot Simple Model to make useful inventions to augument daily life, or playing ultimate frisbee, badminton, or biking. 

Currently working on integrating a VESC with a motor to make my bike electric. 

Please contact me at michael.jia@berkeley.edu or michael.jia26@gmail.com with any questions about my projects or any research/internship opportunities. 

Here you will find a collection of my past computer science projects ranging from HTML websites to Android applications developed with Android Studio and Java Data Structures Projects.
