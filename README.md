I am fourth year undergraduate at UC Berkeley majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Outside of academics, I am the battery lead and structural/chassis advisor of CalSol, the UC Berkeley Solar Vehicle Team (a vehicle team competing in ASC and FSGP).

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering, fabricating designs with my FDM and SLA 3D printers BambuLab X1 Carbon, Voron 2.4 350mm, and Creality LD-006 SLA to make useful inventions to augment daily life. You can find me in my workshop at home, designing or 3d printing new designs! 

Currently working on manufacturing a 5.3 kWh battery pack for Calsol. Also currently researching different infill and material options to manufacture a 3d printable bike seat that can offer a light-weight, low cost, and custom solution for users. Also working on making my own e-bike conversion kit that allows for steep angle uphill climbing for single speed bikes.

Please contact me at michael.jia@berkeley.edu or michael.jia26@gmail.com with any questions about my projects or any research/internship opportunities. 

Here you will find a collection of my past computer science projects ranging from HTML websites to Android applications developed with Android Studio and Java Data Structures Projects and a electromechanical systems IoT project called Moodlighting.
