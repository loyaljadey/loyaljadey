I am second year undergraduate at UC Berkeley majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Aerospace Engineering and a minor in EECS. 

Outside of academics, I am the Structures Lead and Battery Lead of CalSol, the UC Berkeley Solar Vehicle Team. We design, manufacture, and race large scale solar cars cross country.

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering, fabricating cool parts with my Anycubic Vyper and Bambu Lab X1 Carbonto make useful inventions to augument daily life, or playing ultimate frisbee, badminton, or biking. 

Current projects:
-integrating a VESC with a motor to make my bike electric
-making a utensil divider
-making a spinning utensil holder to dry utensils like a washer
-making a autonomous robot to follow a mechanic around and hand them tools

Please contact me at michael.jia@berkeley.edu or michael.jia26@gmail.com with any questions about my projects or any research/internship opportunities. 

Here you will find a collection of my past computer science projects ranging from HTML websites to Android applications developed with Android Studio and Java Data Structures Projects and a electromechanical systems IoT project called Moodlighting.
